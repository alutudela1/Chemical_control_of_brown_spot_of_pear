Brown spot of pear (BSP), a fungal disease of importance in Europe, has been recently detected for the first time in pear orchards in the Alto Valle of Río Negro (Patagonia), Argentina, South America. The disease is caused by Stemphylium vesicarium and its main symptoms are lesions in fruits and leaves. To assess counteracting measures against BSP, the effects of four fungicides were tested to evaluate in vitro efficacy against mycelial growth and spore germination of native S. vesicarium strains, and preventive and curative control of lesion development in pear fruit 'D'Anjou' var. In addition, the activities of two selected fungicides were determined through in-field assays. The fungicides tested were chosen according to their commercial availability and registration in pear crops and included: pyraclostrobin + boscalid (Bellis®); ziram (Ziram®); captan (Merpan®); and Melaleuca alternifolia extract (Timorex®). Bellis® presented the lowest EC50 values in germination and mycelial growth tests. Ziram® and Merpan® were also very effective in inhibiting germination. The plant-based biofungicide Timorex® did not achieve satisfactory effectiveness in in vitro trials, nor in bioassays after preventive and curative treatments. Bioassay results showed that preventive measures using Bellis®, Ziram®, or Merpan® were effective in reducing disease severity and suggested that BSP could be controlled by adequate selection of treatment time.
